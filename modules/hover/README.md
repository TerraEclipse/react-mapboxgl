@react-mapboxgl/hover
==========================

The `Hover` component binds listeners for the appropriate map and layer events,
and tracks changes in the 'hovering' status of features in a layer. You can
either handle hover changes with the `onHoverOver` and `onHoverOut` props or
pass a function as the children who will be updated with `{features, properties}`,
where `features` is an array of hovered features, and `properties` is an array
containing the unique property values of the hovered layers (useful shortcut for filters).
