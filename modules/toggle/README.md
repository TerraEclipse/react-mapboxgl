@react-mapboxgl/toggle
======================

The `Toggle` component binds listeners for the proper map and layer click events
needed to 'toggle' features. You can either respond to toggled features with
the `onToggle` prop, or pass a function as the children which will receive `{features, properties}`,
where `features` is an array of toggled features, and `properties` is an array
containing the unique property values of the toggled layers (useful shortcut for filters).
